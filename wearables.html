<h1>What are Wearables?</h1>
<p>Wearables are clothing items, accessories, or user modifications that can be created by companies or users that can be purchased with MANA to customize their avatars. They can be bought, traded, or sold as NFTs(non-fungible tokens).</p>
<p>You can check out wearables that users and companies are creating over at <a href="https://market.decentraland.org/">marketplace.decentraland.org</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="first_project">First Wearable Project</h2>
            <p>To start out making wearables I started with a simple collared shirt for proof of concept. I ran into this issue where it wouldn't show up in the builder which is a built-in tool for Decentraland that allows users to see and fix problems with their wearables. I closely followed a few tutorials and asked questions on the Discord and was getting no answer.</p>
            <p>I kept going back to the example wearables to try and figure out where exactly I did something wrong but it ended being the models Decentraland provided on their GitHub with the incorrect bones. They had the correct bones on their Google Drive so I was able to replace the skeleton and it finally worked.</p>
            <p>I see that it's clipping through the pants and the model itself doesn't look particularly great (mainly the texture and collar) this was a way to be be sure I could actually make working wearables.</p>

            <h2 id="jacket">Jacket For My Cousin</h2>
            <p>I updated my cousin with the news that I was finally able to create a working wearable. He gave me a project he wanted to create: a vintage floral design bomber jacket. He sent a reference image and I got to work and found a quick vintage floral design on the internet to use as a placeholder until my cousin and I created a better image to use.</p>
            <p>There's clipping on the pants and that will be getting fixed once I receive the pattern that my cousin intends on using for the jacket.</p>

            <h2 id="punk_series">Punk Clothing Collection</h2>
            <p>When I was looking around at the marketplace and what people are putting into the DAO to get approved and found one community to be largely under-represented: the punk/alt community so I decided to start creating an outfit where it would be more represented.</p>

            <h3 id="earrings">Earrings</h3>
            <p>I made quick earrings with studs and an industrial bar because I was so excited that I finally knew how to properly rig up wearables and I got a bit obsessed with earrings for a short period thinking that maybe a cool punk earring set could go through. After looking at the marketplace though, I saw some really good items that quickly made that opinion go away. I ended up settling on one specific design and then got inspiration to create a full punk clothing set.</p>
