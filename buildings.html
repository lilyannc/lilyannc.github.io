      <h1>Buildings for DAO Governance Project</h1>
      <p>My cousin, Trevor had led a project as a grant request for the DAO to create an in-game DAO Governance Forum (more info <a href="https://governance.decentraland.org/proposal/?id=e1c99a80-f565-11eb-ab97-bfa89f33c258">here</a>). His original modeler modelled the entire scene but Trevor still felt it could use a few more additions and messaged me inquiring about a few possible additions we could work out to add to the scene and gave me suggestions on what he wanted to be added.</p>
